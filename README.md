This project implements a movie recommendation system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system utilizes a dataset of movies to recommend similar movies based on their textual descriptions. The recommendation engine employs the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors and then calculates cosine similarity between movies to identify similar ones. Users can input a movie title, and the system will output a list of recommended movies based on textual similarity.
